            <p class="card">Driven by curiosity about the way things work since I've been a child,
              I've always longed for a deeper understanding of the world around me,
              particularly computers and the internet of things.
              This passion led me to enroll in engineering
              and continues to fuel me to this day as a developer.
              Having grown up over several countries (France, USA, Denmark), i like to think
              I have an open mind concerning encounters with new cultures and challenges.</p>
